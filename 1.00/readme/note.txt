On the steady state calculation

1. The BICG method usually starts with an initially randomized rho
   (grandom = true)

2. The TFQMR method can use rho = zero as initial guess 
   (grandom = false)

3. At very low temperature, ntier = 2 is very hard to converge 
   (there may exist multiple steady state solutions, and many of
   them are unphysical). One way to resolve this issue is to
   solve ntier = 3 case first, and then use steady-state rho of
   ntier = 3 as initial rho (the itier <= 2 part) and calculate
   ntier = 2 case.
