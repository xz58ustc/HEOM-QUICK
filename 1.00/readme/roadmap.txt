current approximation 

C_ab(t-tau) = delta_ab * C_aa(t - tau)    (only diagonal correlation is considered)

tentative roadmap:

version = -0.95,  RC1
version = -1.00, final.

1. Efficiency issue of A^T * X operation for solving steady state
   Currently it is done in Liouville space. In the future
   it should be modified and done in Hilbert space
